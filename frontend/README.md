# Frontend

This directory contains a simple React-based interface for generating the Idena whitelist Merkle root and checking an address against it.

At the moment it is a stub with simulated data. Real backend calls and live log streaming will be added later.

To start developing, install dependencies and use a bundler of your choice (for example `vite`). The entry point is `index.html` which loads `src/index.jsx`.
